## Project Overview

A simulated concurrent banking system written in C. It models multiple transactions executing
concurrently against shared bank accounts, using POSIX threads and synchronization primitives
to guarantee correctness under contention.

Core concepts demonstrated:

- Multithreaded transaction execution with a logical simulation clock
- Reader-writer locks for per-account concurrency
- Deadlock prevention via lock ordering AND detection via wait-for graph (DFS cycle detection)
- A bounded buffer pool using semaphores (producer-consumer pattern)
- Metrics collection for throughput, lock contention, and wait times

## Compilation

```bash
make
```

**Debug build with ThreadSanitizer:**
```bash
make debug
```

**Run:**
```bash
./bankdb --accounts=<accounts_file> --trace=<trace_file> \
         [--deadlock=prevention|detection] \
         [--tick-ms=N] \
         [--verbose]
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--accounts=FILE` | Initial account balances file | required |
| `--trace=FILE` | Transaction workload trace file | required |
| `--deadlock=prevention\|detection` | Deadlock handling strategy | `prevention` |
| `--tick-ms=N` | Milliseconds per simulation tick | `100` |
| `--verbose` | Print detailed per-operation logs | off |

---

## Trace File Format

Each line describes one operation belonging to a transaction:

```
T<id> <start_tick> <OPERATION> [args...]
```

Supported operations:

| Operation | Format | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `DEPOSIT` | `T1 0 DEPOSIT <acc> <amount>` | Add centavos to account |
| `WITHDRAW` | `T2 1 WITHDRAW <acc> <amount>` | Remove centavos (aborts if insufficient) |
| `TRANSFER` | `T3 2 TRANSFER <from> <to> <amount>` | Move centavos between accounts |
| `BALANCE` | `T4 3 BALANCE <acc>` | Print current balance |

Amounts are in **centavos** (100 centavos = PHP 1.00).

## Implemented Features

### Week 1

- Updated design documentation (`design.md`)
- Initial repository commits and project structure

### Week 2

- Implemented CLI argument parsing (`utils.c`)
- Implemented timer thread — increments `global_tick` at fixed intervals, broadcasts on `tick_changed` (`timer.c`, `timer.h`)
- Implemented bank and account logic — initialization from file, balance mutations, transfer dispatch (`bank.c`)
- Implemented buffer pool — bounded producer-consumer pool using `sem_t` and `pthread_mutex_t` for thread-safe account load/unload (`buffer_pool.c`)
- Implemented lock manager — deadlock prevention via lock ordering and deadlock detection via wait-for graph with DFS cycle detection; resolves deadlock by aborting the youngest waiting transaction (`lock_mgr.c`)
- Implemented transaction execution — each transaction runs in its own pthread, waits for its `start_tick`, executes all operations, and reports commit or abort (`transaction.c`)
- Implemented metrics — transaction performance table, throughput, average wait time, buffer pool statistics, and money conservation check (`metrics.c`)
- Implemented full thread lifecycle in `main.c` — spawns one pthread per transaction, joins all threads, starts and stops the timer thread
- Added `Makefile` with `all`, `debug`, `clean`, `test`, and `tsan` targets

### Week 3 _(fill in)_

## Running Tests

```bash
make test       # Run all 5 provided test cases
make test1      # Test 1: No conflicts
make test2      # Test 2: Concurrent readers
make test3a     # Test 3: Deadlock prevention
make test3b     # Test 3: Deadlock detection
make test4      # Test 4: Insufficient funds (abort)
make test5      # Test 5: Buffer pool saturation
make tsan       # ThreadSanitizer runs
```

## Design Decisions

See [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) for full rationale. Key choices:

**Deadlock handling:** Both strategies are implemented and selectable via `--deadlock=`. Prevention uses lock ordering (always acquire the lower `account_id` lock first, breaking the circular wait Coffman condition). Detection maintains a wait-for graph and runs DFS cycle detection; resolution aborts the youngest waiting transaction to minimize wasted work.

**Buffer pool:** Bounded producer-consumer pool using `sem_t` (empty/full semaphores) and a `pthread_mutex_t` for the critical section. Accounts are loaded before each operation and unloaded immediately after, keeping pool pressure low.

**Locking:** Per-account `pthread_rwlock_t` allows concurrent reads (BALANCE operations) while serializing writes (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, TRANSFER). Significantly improves throughput on read-heavy workloads compared to plain mutexes.

**Simulation clock:** A dedicated timer thread increments `global_tick` at fixed intervals and broadcasts on `tick_changed`. Transactions call `wait_until_tick()` before starting, enabling reproducible concurrency scenarios.
